# Mutation Testing Report

## Introduction

Mutation testing is a powerful technique to evaluate the quality and effectiveness of a test suite. It involves introducing intentional, small changes (mutations) to the source code and observing how well the test suite can detect these changes. This report presents the results of a mutation testing process applied to the Polynomial class, aiming to assess the reliability and adequacy of its test suite.

## List of Defined Mutation Operators

1. **Change Coefficients Operator:**
   - Description: Mutates polynomial coefficients with random values.
   - Impact: Tests the test suite's sensitivity to changes in coefficient values.

2. **Change Exponentiation Operator:**
   - Description: Squares each coefficient.
   - Impact: Assesses whether the test suite can identify changes in exponentiation.

3. **Remove Coefficients Operator:**

The systematic application of these mutation operators allowed for a comprehensive assessment of the test suite's effectiveness in detecting variations and potential errors in the Polynomial class. Each mutation introduced subtle changes that mimicked real-world scenarios, revealing both the strengths and weaknesses of the test suite. The impact of these mutations extended beyond simple code modifications, providing valuable insights into the test suite's overall sensitivity and coverage. This analysis serves as a foundation for refining the test suite to ensure it remains resilient in the face of potential code changes in the Polynomial class.

### Summary of Mutant Survival and Killing

#### Surviving Mutants

1. **Random Coefficient Changes:**
   - **Observation:** Mutants with altered coefficients went undetected by the test suite.
   - **Analysis:** This highlights a potential weakness in the test suite's coverage, specifically regarding variations in coefficient values.
   - **Recommendation:** Strengthen the test suite by introducing additional test cases that systematically cover a range of coefficient values. This can include extreme values, negative coefficients, and large coefficients to ensure comprehensive coverage.

2. **Exponentiation Alterations:**
   - **Observation:** Mutants with squared coefficients were not consistently detected.
   - **Analysis:** The inconsistent detection suggests a need for improved sensitivity to changes in exponentiation within the test suite.
   - **Recommendation:** Enhance the test cases related to exponentiation, ensuring thorough coverage of scenarios where coefficients are squared. Additionally, consider edge cases where coefficients are set to 1 or 0, as these can reveal potential blind spots in the current test suite.

These observations underscore the importance of addressing specific scenarios within the Polynomial class that may not be adequately covered by the existing test suite. By tailoring test cases to these scenarios, the test suite's ability to detect mutations related to coefficient changes and exponentiation alterations can be significantly improved.

### Killed Mutants

1. **Coefficients Set to Zero:**
   - Test suite successfully identified mutants with zero coefficients.
   - Demonstrates effective detection of missing terms.

2. **Redundant Code Additions:**
   - Mutants with added redundant code were consistently detected.
   - Shows robustness in identifying unnecessary changes.
